# Unclear Firebase Authentication Error Messages

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase Authentication where error messages are not always helpful in diagnosing problems with user account creation.  The example code shows how a network error or an invalid email can result in a vague error that is hard to debug.

The `authBug.js` file contains code that attempts to create a user account, and `authSolution.js` provides a more robust approach with improved error handling.
